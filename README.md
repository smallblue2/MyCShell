## Introduction

This is a POSIX-compliant shell that was developed during my second year of Computer Science in college for an Operating Systems module.

## Initial Shell

To see the well documented development of my initial shell;
* See my lab shell and development/testing at
https://github.com/smallblue2/MyShell
* The foundations for this shell and all exploratory work was done inside that repository.
* This is a clean repository purely for the development of the final product of `myshell`.

## MyShell
A bare-bones, clean POSIX compliant shell for ANSI terminals written in C!

## Compile
Simply type `make`, or `make compile`, and it'll be compiled into the `bin/` directory.

**IMPORTANTLY** run the shell from within the bin/ directory!
This is so your manual and shell environment paths are correct.

**E.g.**

`make compile`

`cd bin`

`./myshell`
